# IDD_Fa20_AltLab2

## Part A. Design your Arduino+

**a) What is the + improvement of your Arduino+

For my Arduino+, I decided to add a second 2.5mm power jack to allow for a dedicated 12V power supply for LED components.

**b) What Arduino form-factor/design are you basing your design off of?

The base board for this design is the Arduino UNO Rev3. 

**c) What features/parts need to be incorporated for your Arduino+? Include your research!

I decided to use the PJ-102B 2.5mm barrel jack. This jack has a small form factor on the board itself, and handles up to 2.5A of current. The LED strip I plan to run from it pulls up to 2A of current, so the jack satisfies all design requirements. 

**d) What is the timeline for the overall development of your Arduino?

After finishing this lab, I will submit the PCB order through OSH Park. I think OSH Park is the best option because they offer reasonably cheap prices while staying in range of domestic shipping. I've found that international shipping during the pandemic can be unreliable, so I'd rather avoid it. Shipping time is 15 days, after which I will solder the components to the board and attach all the peripheral systems. All told, system development should take under a month. 

**e) Which fabrication company are you using, what do you plan to order, and what is the design rationale for the selection?

As stated above, I will be using OSH Park because I would like to avoid international shipping. My experience with international shipping during the pandemic was that it was slow and unreliable. 


## Part B. Order parts for your Arduino+
Develop a bill of materials for your Arduino +.

currently unsure of how to populate a BOM for the parts that are already on the UNO design. 


## Part C. Prototype your Arduino+

**Describe key design questions (how big are the parts? what pins need to be connected?) and how you used/will use prototyping to answer them.



## Part D. Layout your Arduino+
Use EAGLE, KiCAD, Fritzing or the ECAD program of your choice to layout your Arduino +. The source files for the existing Arduino designs is available from Arduino.cc. For example, here is the page with the open source designs for the Arduino UNO R3.

Document what you files, with enough specificity that anyone else could have the same thing made.

## Part E. Send your board off to be made
When you have laid out your board, send it off to be fabricated. You might need to order components, tools or other apparatus (like programmers or FTDI interfaces) to complete the design at this time too.

Document what you sent, and to where, with enough specificity that anyone else could have the same thing made.

In the report, please tell us any pain points you faced in this lab, and how we could make this process easier for future students.
