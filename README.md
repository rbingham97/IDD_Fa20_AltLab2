# IDD_Fa20_AltLab2


Plan:
Modifying the Arduino Uno Rev3
Adding a PJ-102B 2.5mm barrel jack (https://www.snapeda.com/parts/PJ-102B/CUI%20Devices/view-part/378041/?welcome=home)
Using Eagle - I've done some tutorials, and am starting to feel more comfortable with it, but may have questions when I get to this on Monday night.
